# Write a function that takes two integers as arguments.
# Finds all numbers between them (both included) where each digit of the number is an even number.
# For example, for arguments 10 and 30, the function should give you numbers 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28, as they're the only numbers between 10-30 where all digits are even.
# The numbers obtained should be returned as a comma-separated string on a single line.
