# Create a new python file. In that file create a program that works out a grade based on marks with the use of functions.
# The program should take the students name, Homework(/25) score, Assessment(/50) score and Final Exam(/100) score as inputs, and output their name and final ICT grade as a percentage.
# Stretch goal: Include grade boundaries such that the program also outputs a grade for the student (A, B, etc.)
